1. Design a Login Screen
Create a responsive login screen with username, password fields, and a 'Remember Me' checkbox.
Include form validation using JavaScript or a frontend framework.
Optionally, add features like social login buttons (Google, Facebook) and a "Forgot Password" link.

2. Create a Dynamic Form Validator
Instructions:
    Implement a form validation system that:
    Validates multiple fields dynamically (e.g., email, password(lower, upper, symbols and numbers), phone number).
    Uses a configuration object to specify rules.
    Displays errors without reloading the page.
    Support:
    Required fields.
    Regex validation.
    Minimum length validation.

   Expected Outcome:

A modular validation system that adapts to different form fields.
